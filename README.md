Quick referance:
The green ball is the 'golf' ball, when it is not moving, you can click and drag to shoot the ball.
The yellow circle attracts the ball towards it(similar to a planet)
The blue circle reprels the ball
The white circle is a normal obstacle
The purple circle bounces the ball off with a stronger velocity than what it impacted with.
You want to get the green ball into glowing orange circle, that is emitting particles.

Basic gameplay mechanic is done.
